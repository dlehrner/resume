                                    Working on a team of four systems engineers, we enjoy a larger than usual responsibility set within the greater 75-person IT operation that serves the entire city of Henderson, its employees and its 270,000 residents. The system engineering roles here are largely architecture based, highly accountable, and they serve a multitude of concerns from servers to storage to AD all quite autonomously. The team is also trusted at a higher than usual level to evaluate and select vendors. Purchasing recommendations are typically acted upon, with rare exception. And the vendors we deal with now include our major reseller, Microsoft, HP, Splunk, Commvault and Brocade, among others. We are courted by the likes of EMC and other top tier solutions providers, keeping us very up-to-date on what is available on the enterprise market.

                                    Much of our work involves strong collaboration with a separately managed networking team. The cohesiveness we share is really helping to move along the architecting of a Q2 2016 data center move involving 20 cabinets of space including 100 physical servers and 1.5BP of storage running 600 virtual servers. Some boasts regarding my tenure thus far would be an instrumental role in keeping us far beyond the 99% continuity target through all situations and changes. And I also personally deployed a new Citrix (6.5 to 7.6) environment almost immediately after starting this job.

                                          While providing a healthy server environment for 34 locations within Arizona, California and Nevada, I installed, configured and maintained virtual server and desktop environments consisting of 190 hosts, 2,000 virtual desktops and 1,200 virtual servers across three data centers. I frequently travelled to our Phoenix data center as part of the job.

                                          I was able to reduce our server footprint by completing over 100 physical to virtual (P2V) conversions, and I was instrumental in a major data center move which relocated production, production applications and UAT to two geographically separated colocation facilities. This involved 5 Cisco UCS domains across 3 data centers. Along the way, I also led several major ESX Infrastructure upgrade from HP BladeSystem to VCE VBlock to standalone Cisco UCS, later conducting three major Cisco UCS system upgrades impact free (Cisco UCS 1.3 to 1.4; 1.4 to 2.0; and 2.0 to 2.2). One major accomplishment in this role was my having deployed multi-state highly available Private Cloud mission critical systems, including SCADA and customer billing applications.

                                          Provided technical support as an innovative member of the Technology Replacement Team. This required travel to all 34 division offices in Arizona, California and Nevada. This position involved ongoing relationship management with numerous suppliers. Demonstrating natural leadership qualities, highest performance when left to work autonomously and exceptional cohesiveness and interpersonal skills led to my being selected for promotion at the very moment such became a possibility.
